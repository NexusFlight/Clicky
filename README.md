Auto Clicker
When the program is started any key on the keyboard can be set to click a point on the screen.
This is done by pressing any button when the mouse is in the desired position.
Z is set to auto click so set this point where you want the mouse to click all the time
X starts the program running and pauses it if you want to change or add key click bindings
Keybindings can only be set when the program is paused
Esc instantly closes the program.
